# Emdash API to linguistically and grammatically replace em dashes.

Don't you hate how em dashes ruin your carefully curated AI slop?

Remove em dashes and replace them in a linguistically and grammatically correct
way.

I mean, you worked hard on that shit. You prompted and prompted and prompted.
Or maybe you have agents running amok, ruining everyone's feed with your
garbage.

And then people start commenting, bot! Bot! Bot!

Not cool, man.. not cool.

Most of what I've seen online replace em dashes with one character or two 
at the most. Not this! No sir! 

It has to make SENSE!!!! right? right?

Alright, just, do the thing


```
npm i
npm start
```
